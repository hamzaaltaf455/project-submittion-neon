short summary

What I delivered

- Fixed the VA Broken Theme (5 fixes: header, functions, style) — child theme now activates and displays correctly
- Built a responsive, accessible landing page (source + minified dist)
- Implemented the VA Location Directory plugin (CPT, meta fields, shortcode, secure AJAX)
- Optional polish: scroll animations, keyboard navigation, dark mode, and a small build/minify setup

Quick test (local WordPress)

1. Start XAMPP (Apache + MySQL)
2. Install WordPress and copy:
   - Theme → wp-content/themes/va-broken-theme
   - Plugin → wp-content/plugins/va-location-directory
3. Activate the theme and plugin in WP admin (http://localhost/wp-admin or http://localhost/<site>/wp-admin)
4. Create/assign a menu to the Primary location and add a few VA Locations in the plugin
5. Verify: theme renders, CSS loads (no 404s), shortcode [va_locations] shows results, and the landing page opens from `landing-page/dist/index.html`

If something fails, send the browser console output and any PHP error log lines and I will fix it quickly.
